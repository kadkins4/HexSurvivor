HexHold — Run instructions

Prereqs: Node 18+ and npm

Install dependencies and start dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the local address shown by Vite (usually http://localhost:5173)

Notes:
- This is a minimal Vanilla Canvas starter. The game loop lives in `src/game.js`.
- Edit `src/entities/*` and `src/ui/*` to implement gameplay systems (wave manager, upgrades, shop UI).
